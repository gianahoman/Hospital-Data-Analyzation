summary(reg1)


#iii) What is the value of the R^2?
#The value of R^2 is  0.6043.

#iv) What does the R^2 measure in this case?
#The R^2 measures the percentage of variability(approximately 60.43%) of Total Expense that can be explained by the number of Beds.

#v) What are the pvalues ? How many pvalues are reported, why ?What does each pvalue mean?
#The pvalue is <2.2e-16(less than 0.05, reject null hypothesis and Beta is not equal to zero),as there is only one reported value(shown 
#twice but they are both the same) as this is simple regression as there is only one independent variable. 
#The low p-values obtained from the regression analysis suggests that the relationship between the number of beds and total expenses observed in the sample 
# hospital dataset is likely to generalize to the broader population of hospitals, aiding in making inferences about hospital populations based on the sample data.


#vi)Explain R square, pvalues.
#R^2 measure how well a regression model speaks to the fit of a dataset as it is representing the percentage of variation of the total expense
# explained by beds. The pvalues always measures the significance of the regression model through hypothesis tests, as it represents the probability of observing the given result,
#or a more extreme result,under the null hypothesis. Here, we observe of the pvalue is smaller or larger than 0.05, so we can determine significance.


#vii)What would be the right attribute size (independent variable) that seems most appropriate to lead you in the expense range of $55â€“$75 million?
#The proper attribute size to fall within the expense range of 55-75 million dollars ranges from 50720.37 beds and 69201.77 beds.

#55,000,000 = 1084.56x -16060.93 
#   x= 50720.37       
#75,000,000= 1084.56x -16060.93 
#   x = 69201.77      


#4) Multivariate Regression


#i)


ggplot(hospitals, aes(x = Beds, y = Total.Expense, color = Personnel)) +
  geom_point() + labs(title = "Beds and Personnel on Total Expense")

reg2 = lm(Total.Expense ~ Personnel + Beds, hospitals)
summary(reg2)

#ii) What is the value of the R^2?
#The value of R^2 is  0.9121.

#iii) What does the R^2 measure in this case?
#The R^2 measures the percentage of variability(approximately 91.21%) in the dependent variable (Total Expense) that is explained by the change 
#in the independent variables (Personnel and Beds) included in the regression model

#iv) What are the pvalues ? How many pvalues are reported, why ?What does each pvalue mean?
#There are two pvalues(not including the overall pvalue), as this is multivariate regression in which multiple independent variables are included in 
#regression (in this case two : Beds and Personnel).The coefficient for Personnel reveals the pvalue < 2e-16 (less than 0.05), indicating
#that there is a significant relationship between personnel and total expenses in hospitals.
#The coefficient for Beds reveals the pvalue of 1.05e-11(less than 0.05) also suggesting a highly significant relationship 
#between the number of Beds and Total Expenses. The overall pvalue < 2.2e-16, which communicates that there is a significant relationship between 
#beds and personnel, with total expenses, as we reject the null and accept the alternative hypothesis. We can conclude both Beta1 and Beta2 are not equal to zero
#The obtained low p-values provide insights into how the relationships among personnel, number of beds, and total expenses observed in the sample data are indicative 
#of trends that likely extend to the broader population of hospitals.


#v) Explain R square, pvalues.
#R^2 measure how well a regression model speaks to the fit of a dataset as it is representing the percentage of variation of the total expense
# explained by beds and personnel.In this case the R^2 represents the model very well as it is very close to 1. The pvalues always measures the significance 
#of the regression model through hypothesis tests, as it represents the probability of observing the given result, or a more extreme result,under the null 
#hypothesis. Here, we observe of the pvalue is smaller or larger than 0.05, so we can determine significance and the overall and individual pvalues confirm
#that the model is significant.


#5)
#                                 I choose Option A to be better based on the regressions performed.
# - The multivariate regression revealed a stronger R^2(=0.9121) in comparison to the R^2(=0.6043) in our simple regression, hence our indicators or independent 
#   variables(Beds and Personnel) explain the change in total expense better together than beds does alone.
# - As stated in class, this is to be expected as the more columns or attributes added to a regression the higher the R^2 becomes, 
#   which is also why there is an adjusted R^2.

#Based on the regressions and plots, the recommendation leans towards building a smaller hospital facility. This decision is supported by the fact that the
#multivariate model with fewer beds and fewer personnel explains the variation in total expenses effectively, and the range of expenses aligns well 
#with the needs of a smaller facility.
# The range of expense (55 - 75 million),  the range of beds(90-100) of a smaller facility fits best within our expense range,
#hence one again based on all of my regression and plots Option A would be my choice.
